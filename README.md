## Description

Tone Mapper is a a small application by Tizian Zeltner to compare and apply various tone mapping operators. It features an interactive preview and a simple GUI to tweak different parameters.

It was written for the [Multimedia Communications](https://graphics.ethz.ch/teaching/mmcom15/home.php) course at ETH ZÃ¼rich (Fall Semester 2015).

## About this fork

I've added the Gran Turismo operator, and updated the dependencies to make it easy to compile and run.

## Available operators:
* **Linear** - Gamma correction only
* **sRGB** - Conversion to the sRGB color space
* **Reinhard** - From ["Photographic Tone Reproduction for Digital Images"](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~peyre/cours/x2005signal/hdr_photographic.pdf) by Reinhard et al. 2002

* **Divison by maximum**
* **Mean Value Mapping**
* **Clamping**
* **Logarithmic**
* **Exponential**
* **Exponentiation**

Currently, only OpenEXR (.exr) input files are supported. A sample image (example.exr) is included in the project directory.
